# Recommended: configure an authenticated relay for reliable delivery.
# Replace the placeholders below with the credentials from your SMTP provider.
# Do NOT commit real credentials to source control; keep them in a local deployment-only
# .env file (e.g. deployment/smtp/.env) that is excluded from VCS.

# Example for SendGrid (use API key as the password with user 'apikey'):
# RELAY_HOST=smtp.sendgrid.net
# RELAY_PORT=587
# RELAY_USER=apikey
# RELAY_PASS=SG.xxxxx

# Example for Gmail (use an App Password if account has 2FA):
# RELAY_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
# RELAY_PORT=587
# RELAY_USER=you@gmail.com
# RELAY_PASS=<your-app-password>

# If you prefer to not use an upstream relay and allow the local Postfix to send
# directly (not recommended for production), leave RELAY_HOST empty.
